# end-of-stream

A node module that calls a callback when a readable/writable/duplex stream has completed or failed.

	npm install end-of-stream

## Usage

Simply pass a stream and a callback to the `eos`.
Both legacy streams, streams2 and stream3 are supported.

``` js
var eos = require('end-of-stream');

eos(readableStream, function(err) ***REMOVED***
  // this will be set to the stream instance
	if (err) return console.log('stream had an error or closed early');
	console.log('stream has ended', this === readableStream);
***REMOVED***);

eos(writableStream, function(err) ***REMOVED***
	if (err) return console.log('stream had an error or closed early');
	console.log('stream has finished', this === writableStream);
***REMOVED***);

eos(duplexStream, function(err) ***REMOVED***
	if (err) return console.log('stream had an error or closed early');
	console.log('stream has ended and finished', this === duplexStream);
***REMOVED***);

eos(duplexStream, ***REMOVED***readable:false***REMOVED***, function(err) ***REMOVED***
	if (err) return console.log('stream had an error or closed early');
	console.log('stream has finished but might still be readable');
***REMOVED***);

eos(duplexStream, ***REMOVED***writable:false***REMOVED***, function(err) ***REMOVED***
	if (err) return console.log('stream had an error or closed early');
	console.log('stream has ended but might still be writable');
***REMOVED***);

eos(readableStream, ***REMOVED***error:false***REMOVED***, function(err) ***REMOVED***
	// do not treat emit('error', err) as a end-of-stream
***REMOVED***);
```
